# medmarkdown

medmarkdown is a TYPO3 extension that uses [PHP markdown](https://github.com/michelf/php-markdown/) to convert text written in markdown to HTML. medmarkdown uses a customizd version of [jQuery markdown editor](https://github.com/digitalnature/jQuery-Markdown-editor) to work in the TYPO3 backend.

You can also link to page ID's within the system; the extension generates a valid TypoLink by itself.
